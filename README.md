# Water Quality Affecting Real World

Water is both a basic human right and a requirement for optimal health. Excessive salt and/or metal accumulation in the water through the soil is one of the worst repercussions of poor water quality. The data gathered from the Environmental Protection Agency will be subject to clustering analysis in this research. This can be achieved via cluster analysis based on the computed similarity between the dissolved metals. To better understand the factors that affect water quality, regression and cluster analysis were applied to a real-world dataset of water quality measurements collected from various locations. The regression analysis aimed to identify the relationships between water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, hydrogen bicarbonate, and dissolved metals like calcium, chloride, sulphate, salt, and magnesium.

## Methodology
Water has and always will have dissolved metals in it, so we suggest a system in which we group the water based on the commonalities seen in the dissolved metal measurements. The Spearman rank correlation is the appropriate correlation approach to examine the relationship between water pH and other indicators of water quality. The Correlation Matrix of various water quality indicators describes the degree of linear linkage between two random terms. Because the issue in this project is a typical classification problem, the two machine learning methods that have proven to be most successful in resolving it are logistic regression and K-means clustering. Clustering analysis based on the similarity between the readings of the dissolved metals in it will help us to categorize the water. Both machine learning techniques produced useful results for the analysis and classification problem, thereby resolving the issue at hand. The results of the regression analysis showed that temperature and pH had a significant impact on dissolved oxygen levels, and that turbidity was strongly correlated with total suspended solids. These findings can help inform water quality management strategies and policies, by identifying the factors that most strongly affect water quality and the areas that require targeted interventions.
